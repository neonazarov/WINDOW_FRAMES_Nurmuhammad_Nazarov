Overview
This SQL query is designed to generate a sales report for a specific period in 1999, focusing on weeks 49, 50, and 51. The report includes daily sales amounts, a cumulative sum of sales for each week, and a centered 3-day moving average of sales.

 Query Features
1. Date Range Filtering: Selects sales data between December 6th and December 31st, 1999, which corresponds to weeks 49 to 51 of that year. 
   
2. Cumulative Sum Calculation: Computes the cumulative sum of sales for each week.

3. Centered 3-Day Moving Average: Calculates a moving average of sales amount for each day, considering the sales amount of the current day, one day preceding, and one day following.

 Components
The query is composed of two main parts:
1. Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
   - `SalesData`: Filters the main sales table for the specified date range and extracts the week number from each date.
   - `CumulativeSum`: Computes the cumulative sum of sales for each filtered week.

2. Main Query:
   - Selects the date, sales amount, week number, cumulative sum, and calculates the centered 3-day average using a window function.

 Usage
To use this query, replace `sales_table` with the actual name of your sales data table. The table should have at least two columns: `sales_date` (date of sale) and `sales_amount` (amount of sale). Adjust the date range in the `WHERE` clause of the `SalesData` CTE to match the specific weeks of interest in your dataset.

 Compatibility
This query is written in standard SQL and uses window functions. It is compatible with most modern relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, MySQL 8.0+, SQL Server, etc. However, please ensure compatibility with your specific SQL dialect, especially for date functions like `EXTRACT`.

 Note
- The exact weeks covered by the date range may vary depending on the calendar system used by your database. Adjust the dates in the `WHERE` clause as necessary.
- The performance of the query can vary based on the size of the dataset and the specific RDBMS used.
